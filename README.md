<h2>Phone Number Generator</h2>

<blockquote>
  <h4>Directions</h4>
  <p>The Phone Number Generator has two functions to it. The first allows the user to enter a phone number and see possible word combinations from the numbers based on the 10 button keypad. (For example, 1=abc, 2 =def etc) The second function is the reverse of the first function. Instead of entering a phone number to make words, the user inputs a seven letter word or letter combination, and the program returns all possible phone numbers translate into the phrase they want.</p>
